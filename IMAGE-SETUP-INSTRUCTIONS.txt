<!-- 
To use the payment success background image:

1. Save the image from the attachment as "payment-success-bg.jpg"
2. Place it in the public folder: d:\Menu\MENU-FRONTEND\public\payment-success-bg.jpg
3. The CSS is already configured to use this image

The image path in CSS: url('/payment-success-bg.jpg')
This will load from the public folder when the app runs.

If you prefer to place the image in the src folder instead:
1. Save as: d:\Menu\MENU-FRONTEND\src\payment-success-bg.jpg  
2. Update the CSS path to: url('./payment-success-bg.jpg')
